shadow: module packaging
Written by Dark_Aaron on Aug 31, 2012

shadow is an IRC bot platform, we want people to share and contribute modules.  To make 
the experience of installing a module more pleasent, we have decided the correct way of
doing such is to automate the process as much as possible.

To do this, we need to first set a standard on how modules are packaged and distributed.
Those methods and tips are explained throught this document.

1.) The Module Sources

   For sanity reasons, we must try and maintian a constant as to how we layout the code
   for our modules.  This in the long run will make things a lot easier for both
   developers and users.  I will demonstrate the layout of a common module, named Uptime
   here:

       Uptime                           Our module's directory in modules/
       |-- module.json                  The JSON file which describes the module.
       |-- Uptime.pm                    The module's code file
       |-- install                      Directory for files related to the install
       `-- `-- uptime.config            This is moved to etc/modules/

2.) The module.json File

    The module.json file is a file which describe the module it tells the author, purpose,
    dependencies, and other useful information.  An example of a module.json file can be
    seen here:

       {
           "name": "OmegleBridge",
           "description": "Bridges a PM to an Omegle client instance.",
           "author": {
               "name": "Dark_Aaron",
               "email": "aaron@ephasic.org",
               "url": "http://ephasic.org/~ablakely"
           },
           "module": {
               "compatibility": {
                    "linux": true,
                    "freebsd": true,
                    "darwin": true,
                    "win32": false
                },
                "dependencies": [
                    "New::Omegle"
                ]
            }
         }

    For the list of values to use in module.compatibility see doc/perlos.txt
