shadow: module packaging

shadow is an IRC bot platform, we want people to share and contribute modules.  To make
the experience of installing a module more pleasant, we have decided the correct way of
doing such is to automate the process as much as possible.

To do this, we need to first set a standard on how modules are packaged and distributed.
Those methods and tips are explained throughout this document.

1.) The Module Sources

   For sanity reasons, we must try and maintain a constant as to how we layout the code
   for our modules.  This in the long run will make things a lot easier for both
   developers and users.  I will demonstrate the layout of a common module, named Uptime
   here:

       Uptime                           Our module's directory in modules/
       |-- module.json                  The JSON file which describes the module.
       |-- src				Module source dir
       |-- `-- Uptime.pm
       |-- install			Install related stuff
       |-- |-- pre.pl			Pre-install script
       `   `-- uptime.conf		Module config, is moved to etc/modconf

2.) The module.json File

    The module.json file is a file which describe the module it tells the author, purpose,
    dependencies, and other useful information.  An example of a module.json file can be
    seen here:

    {
        "module": {
                "name": "Uptime",
                "description": "Simple uptime module for *nix systems.",
                "version": "0.0.1",
                "license": "GPL",
                "git": "https://github.com/ablakely/shadow"
        },

        "author": {
                "name": "Dark_Aaron",
                "email": "aaron@ephasic.org",
                "url": "http://ephasic.org/~ablakely"
        },

        "system": {
                "compatibility": {
                        "Unix":         true,
                        "Mac":          true,
                        "DOS":          false,
                        "macos":        false,
                        "DEC OS":       false,
                        "EBCDIC":       false,
                        "Misc.":        false
                },
                "dependencies": []
        },

        "install": {
                "prescript":    "install/pre.pl",
                "srcdir":       "src/"
        }
    }
